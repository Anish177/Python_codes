# Python_codes

Just a few python scripts/project that I did for fun, spread apart around 6 months, with most time spent in trying to decide what to do next as I got bored from most projects and left them.

Some of them work just fine, while others are a WIP which I probably got uninterested in and left.

One of the things I'm most proud of is the "spotify_adder".
